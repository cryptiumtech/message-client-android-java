Message Client for Android
==========================

This repository contains source code for an SMS application for Android,
named Vital.

This is a work in progress. The main features we hope to eventually complete:

* reliable single and group chat
* organize conversations into "favorites", "contacts", and "recents"
* separate notification settings for "favorites", "contacts", and "recents"
* auto-upgrade to Internet-based, end-to-end encrypted chat
* pictures and attachments
